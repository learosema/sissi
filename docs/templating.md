Sissi comes with a basic markdown and html template engine.

## HTML Includes

You can include HTML via the html-include tag. It will fetch the partial HTML snippet from the `_includes` subfolder and inserts it in the right place. This part is heavily inspired by the [Going Buildless approach by Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/blog/buildless/) 

```html
<html-include src="header.html">
```

## Template Data

Sissi supports a "poor girl's handlebars". It looks for expressions wrapped in double curly braces and replaces them with the data accordingly.  More details on this is in the next section about data.

If you put a `meta.json` inside the data dir, you can access it via curly brace notation:

```js
// meta.js
{
  "author": "Lea Rosema"
}
```

```html
<author>{\{ meta.author }\}</author>
```

The code above will resolve to {{ meta.author }} (there is a meta.json in this site.)

## Built-in filters

You can provide one or multiple filters via the pipe notation:

### Do not escape (`safe`)

By default, angle brackets are escaped to `&lt;` and `&gt;`, in order to avoid injections. You can turn this off by adding a safe pipe to your expression:

```html
{\{ content | safe }\}
```

### Serialize to JSON (`json`)

You can serialize objects to JSON:

```html
{\{ meta | json }\}
```

### Resolve asynchronous JavaScript (`async`)

```html
{\{ fetchJson('https://yesno.wtf/api') | async }\}
```

### Iterate through array (`each`)

```html
{\{ fetchJson('people.json') | async | eachItem: (item) => `<li>${item}</li>` }\}
```

### Work in progress

The following are unpolished and subject to change.

- `numberFormat`: format as number
- `currency`: format as currency
- `limit`: limit an array
- `reverse`: reverse an array

## Custom filters

You can add custom filters inside your config:

```js
config.addFilter('SCREAM', (str) => str.toUpperCase());
config.addFilter('piratify', 
  (str, prefix = 'Yo-ho-ho', suffix = 'yarrr') => 
    `${prefix}! ${str}, ${suffix}!`
);
```

```html
{\{ meta.author | SCREAM }\}
resolves to LEA ROSEMA
{\{ "Hello " + meta.author | piratify: 'Aye' }\} resolves to "Aye! Hello Lea Rosema, yarrr!"
```

## Execute arbitrary JavaScript expressions

You can run arbitrary JavaScript inside the curly brackets:

```html
<ul>
  {\{ people().map(person => `<li>${person}</li>`).join('') | async }\}
</ul>
```

### But there is no await (yet?)

With asynchronous content, things get a bit trickier, as there is no `await`.

Imagine you defined a `fetchJson` helper function:

```js
// _data/fetchJson.js
export default async function fetchJson(request) {
  const response = await fetch(request);
  const json = await response.json();
  return json;
}
```

This is why there is the async filter. You can combine it with the `each` filter function.

```js
// _data/ListItem.js
export default function ListItem(item) {
  return `<li>${item}</li>`
}
```

```html
<ul>
  {\{ fetchJson('people') | async | each: ListItem }\}
</ul>
```

The async filter resolves the promise of the fetch request. When the result is an array,
the `each` operator takes each item, passes it to the ListItem
function and then concatenates the result.
