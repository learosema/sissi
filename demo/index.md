Sissi üë∏ stands for `Small Indieweb Static SIte` and is a configuration-free minimalistic static-site generator, inspired by [eleventy](https://11ty.dev), but for an even more minimalistic approach.

It has zero node-modules dependencies.

This is a silly but serious experiment by [Lea](https://lea.lgbt/@lea) about how far we can get with dependency-free node.js.

This must be how [Zach](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) started Eleventy ‚ò∫Ô∏èüéà.

## What does it include?

- Configuration API similar to Eleventy
- some Plugin Compatibility with Eleventy
- a basic templating engine with Markdown and HTML
- a Development server with watch mode

## Is it here to compete with Eleventy?

Nope. Eleventy is awesome and I am a proud [supporter](https://opencollective.com/lea-rosema) of it (I'm pretty broke though so it's only a small amount I'm contributing).

I want to get a basic understanding about static site generators and want to evaluate if the complexity could be reduced further. That may come with the cost of flexibility and cut-down of features.

Also, I suffer from npm fatigue, so I want that node_modules folder to shrink.
