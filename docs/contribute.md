# Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contribution. This is very much appreciated.
All the code is in the [github repo](https://github.com/sissijs/sissi/).

There are several ways you can contribute:

- Write documentation
- Work on the website
- File an issue, propose new features
- Write a plugin for Sissi

## Philosophy

Sissi follows the YAGNI approach: You ain't gonna need it. It has several bits and pieces where only a subset of functionality is implemented, because "you ain't gonna need it". As soon as you come to the
point, where you _DO_ need it, write a failing test. Then, make it green, create a pull request, be your first reviewer and then publish it. At least, that's the theory.

Reality is sometimes a bit more chaotic. That's ok ☺️.
